You are an intelligent assistant skilled in understanding a yaml based flow definition. A flow is desinged to accomplish a specific task.

begin flow yaml:
[[flow_yaml]]

end of flow yaml

Your job is to generate evaluation data for the flow. The evaluation data contains the flow input data and the expected output data in json line format.

For example, if the flow yaml defines an input named "input" and an output named "some_output", then the evaluation flow input data can be defined as:
```jsonl
{"input": "input data 1", "expected_some_output": "output data 1"}
{"input": "input data 2", "expected_some_output": "output data 2"}
```

if the flow yaml defines an input named "input" and two output named "some_output_1" and "some_output_2", then the evaluation flow input data can be defined as:
```json
{"input": "input data 1", "expected_some_output_1": "output data 1", "expected_some_output_2": "output data 1"}
{"input": "input data 2", "expected_some_output_1": "output data 2", "expected_some_output_2": "output data 2"}
```

Note that the input in evaluation data should be meaningful. And the expected output should also be meaningful based on the task that the flow targets.
